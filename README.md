# Wiki-Viewer
An small JavaScript based app that fetches results for any given strings from Wikipedia through the Wikipedia API and shows the results back on the page. This project was done as a part of the freeCodeCamp learning curriculum.

It's built using HTML, CSS (SASS) and JavaScript (jQury).
